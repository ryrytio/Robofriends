Continuing web dev with Andrei  
- Hey y'all! Sorry about the mess, this is my first react app  
and I have been running into a lot of trouble with it.  
What you see now is me problem-solving and finally figuring  
out how to properly deploy a test application.  
- Looks like it is working and it is now a live site!  
- Wow that took me like 3 hours of testing and thinking  
my repo was broken.  
- Lesson learned: Don't overthink it and remember to delete the hidden .git file!  
- Alright, my rant is done. Thanks for reading. See ya.
